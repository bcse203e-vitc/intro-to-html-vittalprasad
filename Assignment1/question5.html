    <p>
       <u> Harper Lee</u> ,believed to be one of the most <b><i>influential</i></b> authors to have ever existed, <b><i>famously</i></b> published only a  <b><i>single</i></b> novel (up until its controversial sequel was published in 2015 just before her death). Lee's <u>To Kill a Mockingbird</u> was published in 1960 and became an  <b><i>immediate</i></b>  <b><i>classic</i></b> of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South through the  <b><i>innocent</i></b> wide eyes of a <b><i>clever</i></b> young girl named <u>Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch</u>. Its iconic characters, most notably the <b><i>sympathetic</i></b>  and <b><i>just</i></b> lawyer and father <u>Atticus Finch</u>, served as <b><i>role</i></b> models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time when tensions regarding race were high. To Kill a Mockingbird earned the <u>Pulitzer Prize</u> for fiction in 1961 and was made into an <u>Academy Award</u>-winning film in 1962, giving the story and its characters further life and influence over the  <b><i>American</i></b> social sphere.
